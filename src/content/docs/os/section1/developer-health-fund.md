While the overall themes of burnout and overworking provide us with common ground, our individual experiences and situations are unique and personal. Regardless of intention and motivation, some changes may be extraordinarily difficult or impossible to implement due to a lack of access to necessary resources. Because of this, we've created the Developer Health Fund, a donor-backed reserve allocated to the global tech community's physical, mental, and emotional health.

Developer health prioritizes the well-being of technologists in a way that provides the access, approval, support, protection, and/or resources necessary to:

- Gain and afford medical attention and care 
- Spend time meaningfully engaged with friends, family, and loved ones 
- Take time for rest, vacation, medical care, recovery, parenthood, bereavement, and anything else that contributes to overall health 
- Consistently rest and recharge in a way that allows for a steady and maintainable work rhythm 

We believe that end-to-end developer health includes deep partnerships to serve developers and part of this vision is the Developer Health Fund. With support from the tech industry and our community, it's our goal to have ongoing access to financial resources where developers can apply to withdraw funds to support anything that would improve health, including their journey to a restful work experience.

While we do not claim to have all the answers, we invite you on this journey with us as fellow travelers and learners. We invite you into this community of curious workers wishing to challenge the status quo. We know that more is possible and that together, we can chip away at a tech culture that does not serve us anymore and replace it with one that will facilitate lasting change in our work and personal lives.
