title: Blaze Your Own (Neural) Path
description: Forging and reinforcing neural pathways in the brain
---

The human experience is a complex experience. From our first moments in the world, we observe, learn, and adapt to the environment around us, forging and reinforcing neural pathways in the brain that cement perception, reaction, and understanding. Not every connection or response stored in our minds is beneficial to us, and the longer we hold these beliefs as true, the harder they are to dissolve in order to create connections that are beneficial. This is partially why “just doing healthy things” is neither easy nor simple. In some cases, our mind is wired in such a way that we need more than habit trackers and cooling mattresses to jump-start our desire for a healthier life. 

Finding a professional therapist who can help us organize, observe, and clarify our experiences may be necessary to break down barriers preventing growth. Not all therapists are trained to advise on all human experiences, though. By being honest about our struggles and goals, we can seek out a professional who is best suited to our needs. 

We can also take advantage of our brain's neuroplasticity and ability to rewire our neural pathways through neuromodulating strategies such as Neurofeedback, DNRS, HeartMath, and The Gupta Programme. These approaches can be beneficial for people experiencing an array of conditions, including chronic illness, ADHD, anxiety, and depression, and may appeal to those not yet comfortable with discussing past experiences with a therapist.
