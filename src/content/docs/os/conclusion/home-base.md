description: A place we can always return to
---

At G2i, it’s our mission to improve the physical and mental health of software developers. We believe that tech workers who prioritize caring for their minds, just as professional athletes do with their bodies, will unlock higher potential and increased productivity. Supporting this vision means providing the resources, funding, community, and tools to help people achieve these goals, which includes the Developer Health OS. 

While we’ve covered several topics in the Developer Health OS, we don’t want this information to become overwhelming by trying to apply everything all at once. Referring back to the tenets of habit forming, we start with one thing at a time and take small steps to encourage success. This can be applied to budgeting our time, creating Daily Action Plans, reflecting regularly on our work, setting boundaries, slowing down, and more. Finding the best work-life for each of us is a perpetual journey of learning, understanding, and experimenting while asking ourselves tough questions and giving honest answers. 

Our health and habits will certainly ebb and flow as we handle the unpredictable nature of life and work, and that is to be expected. By working through the exercises and suggestions given in the Developer Health OS, we can create our individual north stars for how we’d like to spend our time, decide what is a priority to us, and take decisive steps to protect ourselves from long-term issues or damage. Regardless of how far we may fall away from our routines, we always have a place to return to start anew.
