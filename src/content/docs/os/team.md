Our motivation for creating the Developer Health OS comes from deeply personal experiences related to our health in the tech industry.

### Gabe Greenberg

Gabe spent more than eight years suffering from a chronic illness rooted in consistent overworking. While building the company, Gabe clocked 60 to 70-hour work weeks on average, all while growing more distant from his wife and young children. For years, Gabe experienced extreme headaches, fatigue, and pain throughout his body daily. It wasn't until he was diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) caused by exposure to toxic mold that he was forced to slow down and reevaluate his work/life priorities and practices. 

The path to recovery required honest self-reflection, regularly meeting with health professionals for mental and physical health, leadership coaching, and a complete overhaul of how Gabe worked and ran his company. This was only made possible by the support of the 
global developer ecosystem that rallied behind Gabe, which raised money for his medical expenses and offered him encouragement. 

Creating developer health programming and resources is a means of giving back to the developer community that aided Gabe's recovery and paying forward the [aid he received](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-gabe-get-healthy1). Gabe's story isn't unique; the industry has already planted the seeds of support, and our goal is to simply water, or champion, this existing foundation.

Michelle has been a software developer for the last several years at companies of various sizes and industries. Although her first job was with a phenomenal company, the team she was personally on was saddled with bureaucracy that allowed harassment and toxic behavior to continue for years without accountability. Without prior experience in the tech industry, Michelle pushed through persistent systemic issues until the stress manifested into an alarming heart condition that affected every part of her life, from work meetings to washing dishes. 

The cardiologist told Michelle that the only way to alleviate her heart issues was to remove the underlying stressors while managing the symptoms with temporary medication. Michelle changed jobs, and everything seemed great, until it wasn’t. Her new position became untenable, and her heart condition returned. Defeated, she wondered if every job would be like this and if staying in tech meant enduring heart issues indefinitely. 

Michelle and Gabe met through their local tech community in South Florida and quickly learned of their shared experiences with health issues. The two agreed that the industry lacked a dedicated focus on the health of technologists despite how common it is for tech workers to experience burnout and extreme stress. Shortly after their meeting, Michelle officially joined G2i to lead programming and initiatives to support developers' physical and mental health, which has included the creation of The Developer Health Operating System.
