No matter the stage of our career, it’s important to establish boundaries between us and our workplace. 

Whether these are boundaries for a new job or current workplace, they are an important piece of the puzzle in protecting your mental, physical, and emotional health at work.

To tie it back to the non-workaholic workplace — once you have your work boundaries, the non-workaholic workplace is a place that will support the established boundaries.
