- Learn from others. The people around us, such as colleagues, friends, and family, may have their own insights on workplace boundaries and can be a vital resource in learning ours. Plus, they can help hold us accountable to enforcing the boundaries we’re establishing. 

-  Be gentle with ourselves, hard on our workplaces. Establishing boundaries does not make everything instantly easier. There will be times when it’s challenging to enforce or communicate our needs and expectations. During these difficult moments, think back on why these boundaries exist. They are here to protect us and provide us with the environment needed to do our best work. We may break a boundary occasionally because of an acceptable exception or pressure. For whatever reason, we shouldn’t beat ourselves up for this, but instead grow from it. Learn how you can be more firm with your workplace, and gentler with ourselves.

- Be honest — ask why we’re setting this boundary. Understanding why we have a boundary helps enforce it. For example, if the boundary is, “I will not have work apps on personal devices,” think about the reason why. Remembering that a certain work app creates a distraction during family events or keeps us up later at night can be an effective way to remove the temptation of convenient access. 

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to work boundaries. Every individual has different limits, career goals, and situations. 

With this in mind, refer back to the Bottom, Middle, and Top Lines framework to help categorize boundaries as they’re being set.
