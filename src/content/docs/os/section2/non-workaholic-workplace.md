Non-workaholic companies actively put their employees first. They take care of their customers and products, but not at the expense of their own people.

This type of organization has the ability to stop and ask themselves: Why? These workplaces put time and effort into establishing the reasons for existing beyond just growing for the sake of growing. Their leaders and founders challenge themselves to answer difficult questions about why they started their company in the first place.

Non-workaholic workplaces are comfortable with themselves and their organization's identity. They have a defined culture. They want to grow and achieve new successes, but they do not endlessly chase them.
