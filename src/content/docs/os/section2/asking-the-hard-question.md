description: Finding the workplace and work pace that is the healthiest fit for us

Ultimately, the goal of creating workplace boundaries is to find the workplace and work pace that is the healthiest fit for us. 

Unfortunately, we may discover that the work boundaries needed to be healthy are difficult to reinforce in our current company. Instead of immediately conceding our needs, we can investigate this misalignment further to determine if there is a possibility of working towards alignment or if this is an indicator to begin searching for another opportunity at a different company.

A big part of finding healthy and restful work is finding a workplace that allows us to enforce our boundaries and supports our development of healthy work habits. We deserve to find that workplace.
