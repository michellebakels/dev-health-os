title: Creating Top Lines, Middle Lines, and Bottom Lines
description: Clearly define and commit to a starting place for our boundaries

<em>Bottom Lines</em> 
This is the starting point. This is where we make an agreement with ourselves about our non-negotiables and guard these at all costs. If we break these boundaries, we’re out of balance and potentially heading towards work addiction. Be careful not to pick too many bottom lines. Only focus on the most important things. 

<em>Middle Lines</em>
This is the gray area. If these boundaries break, it indicates to us that we are headed in the wrong direction. They are signals or warning signs. 

<em>Top Lines</em>
These are the areas we ultimately want to focus on. These are the habits we want to do regularly. Living in our top lines keeps us removed from our bottom line behaviors. 

Ultimately, we must figure out what is healthy for us when setting these boundaries. Putting them down on paper and keeping them available is extremely helpful. Here are some suggestions for starting: 

- Don't overfill your plate. Start with 1-2 items in each category and build from there.
- Focus on the top lines. Aim for what we want to do the most. 
- We can always change our top, bottom, and middle lines as time goes on. This is about experimenting and getting to a place of health. 
- Consistency is the most important part of this process. Make the top lines achievable and practice them for a few months before potentially adding more. This process is intentionally slow. 
- It's very helpful to find a mentor who has a good work/life balance and can serve as a sounding board when working through this process. 

When creating your bottom, middle, and top lines, it’s important to write them down. Put them on paper or a document you can regularly check. You’ve done the hard work of determining your boundaries — now you have to enforce them. 

And if you’re feeling unsure about your boundaries? Reach out to your mentor, your friends, or trusted colleagues for advice and feedback — you’ll learn from their feedback, and you might help them establish a new boundary or two in the process.
