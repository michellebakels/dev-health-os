title: Slowing Down
description: The foundation to restful work

If we were asked to "slow down" or "find time," how many of us would reply that we canâ€™t? There are too many things on our plates, and there's just no time.

Slowing down allows us to inventory how we're scheduling our time, think deeply about our goals, and assess whether those actions are supporting our ultimate intention. To slow down, we need to fiercely defend our time and be selective about the work we engage with in order to optimize that commitment. We waste less time, we know exactly how we're progressing, and we can think more clearly without the burden of an overflowing agenda. 

High-performing athletes have schedules that build their work and skill toward the goal of winning championships. They concertedly spend their time in a way that doesn't just get things done but positions them closer to being the best in their field. It's not enough to show up to practice if the training routine isn't targeting the proper areas of focus necessary to improve. Exercises are chosen with considerable intention in order to become the best as quickly as possible. 

With this said, overdoing work or going too hard too soon introduces a high risk of injury and excessive fatigue. Working out every day for hours on end while pushing it as far as they can means that by the day they need to perform their best, their body is effectively destroyed... spent... burned out. Pushing too hard daily increases the risk of injury. Even pulling a muscle can require recovery periods that range from a week to potentially ending a career. Not only do athletes schedule their workouts, but they also schedule the intensity of those workouts and the rest time that follows. 

<em>Rest is equally imperative to the pursuit of excellence as work.</em>

There are times to push our limits, and there are times for recovery, but we should always know exactly why we are doing that and how this helps us accomplish our goals. We need to actively consider our sleep and rest cycles as part of our journey instead of an inconvenient side effect of being alive. We need to slow down, assess, and execute effectively.
