We've designed Developer Health OS to focus on three main areas: Burnout Recovery, Burnout Prevention, and Optimizing Performance, with the singular goal of creating an environment of Restful Work.

**Burnout Recovery:** Identifying the issues that initially caused burnout and systematically developing healthier work habits and boundaries. 

**Burnout Prevention:** Building sustainable work habits to avoid experiencing burnout and repeating a cycle of ruin and recovery. 

**Optimum Performance:** Prioritizing oneâ€™s health can increase performance even without being specifically concerned about burnout.
