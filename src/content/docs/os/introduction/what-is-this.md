title: What is The Developer Health OS?
description: A brief intro to The Developer Health OS
---

The Developer Health OS is an opinionated framework for burnout prevention, recovery, and optimal performance at work. At G2i, we believe that when we prioritize our health to create a solid foundation of mental and physical resilience, the resulting positive effects touch all facets of our personal and professional lives. 

Through a combination of an interactive curriculum, a supportive community, and health-focused services, The Developer Health OS takes an integrated and structured approach to sustainably growing your career while always prioritizing your health. 

## Our Vision

In professional sports, athletes regularly discuss rest, treatment, training, diet, coaching, and mental health as the primary inputs to see output in their respective sports. In other words, putting health first to see a performance increase is foundational to their overall success on–and off–the field. This framework is taught and reinforced by mentors, team leaders, coaches, and doctors, creating a sustainable ecosystem where the messaging is reinforced at every level of an athlete’s career. Yet, a health-first approach eludes tech workers and software developers because we use our brains more than our physical bodies to produce output. Due to this flawed logic, prioritizing mental and physical health is not explicitly taught or genuinely addressed through academic programs, such as those at universities or coding boot camps.

Software developers' physical and mental health is one of the most underserved areas in technology today, similar to many professional sports environments in the 1970s, when athletes were provided a team doctor for acute injuries but were expected to figure the rest out for themselves. Fifty years later, professional athletes receive the highest level of care and technology to support their recovery, rest, and performance. We at G2i believe that software developers deserve the same level of care and compassion that is bestowed upon athletes, and our mission is to increase both the physical and mental health of software developers.

The tech industry must continue to invest in a better developer experience through open source and better tooling. More importantly, it's time we looked outside of the computer and focused on the health of the person physically writing the code that enables all of us to perform to our highest abilities on—and off—our unique playing fields.
