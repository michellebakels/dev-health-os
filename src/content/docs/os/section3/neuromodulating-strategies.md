Neurofeedback is a type of therapy that trains individuals to regulate their own brain activity and ultimately teaches the brain to rewire itself. Advances in technology have resulted in the potential to have home-based training through online remote monitoring rather than the need to attend a neurofeedback clinic. A neurofeedback specialist creates a protocol based on your brain map, usually with the intent of having the brain revert back to a normal baseline, and the person is given feedback through a system of rewards. These rewards can come in the form of a pleasant sound or a visual image when they are able to produce the desired brain activity, over time the individual learns to control their brain activity and can use this ability to manage their symptoms and improve their overall functioning. 


Neurofeedback has been shown to be effective in a number of conditions, including ADHD, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. It is generally considered to be a safe and non-invasive treatment option with few side effects. It should be administered by a trained and qualified healthcare professional.
