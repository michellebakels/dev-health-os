## How to Find a Therapist

1. Use a **referral source** that feels safe and comfortable, whether that means going through your insurance provider, asking a family member or friend, or following counsel from a mentor or religious leader.

2. **Cost and location** need to be considered so that you will not add extra stress to the therapeutic process.

3. **Refine your search** by asking yourself simple questions such as:  
    a. Do you have a preference for the gender of your therapist?  
    b. Do you prefer online or in-person therapy sessions?  
    c. Does this counseling focus on individual, family, or marital concerns?  
    d. Do you want a specialist who works with specific cultures or groups such as National Eating Disorders, LGBTQ+, or resources for people of color?  

4. Your **why and goals** for therapy are important to know to choose a therapist who has the appropriate expertise to assist you in achieving the results you want and can assist you in making clear benchmarks and expectations. 

5. **Ask** them questions such as:  
    a. What is your area of expertise?  
    b. What is your modality or intervention approach?  
    c. How long until I can expect to see changes?  
    d. Can you provide a [super bill](https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/what-is-a-superbill/) for my insurance?  

6. **Notice** their overall approach during your session and take note of how you felt. Within 3-5 sessions, you should know if you are comfortable, feel like you are making progress, and if there is rapport. You should walk away feeling listened to, understood, validated, and progressing towards your goals. Therapists’ personal styles vary. Be honest with yourself if you want to work with someone who asks more or less questions or who does or does not give homework.  

7. Green Flags  
    a. Licensed or Registered Intern  
    b. Professional attire and environment, even online  
    c. They follow your style, such as wanting homework or materials to read  

8. Red Flags  
    a. Videotape or record you without your consent  
    b. Arrive late consistently or forget appointments  
    c. Talk most of the session, or you feel like the therapist  
    d. They have an agenda and do not want your input  
    e. They have inappropriate boundaries, for example, asking you out to coffee  
    f. They claim to have a treatment that is one size fits all or can cure anything  
    g. Pressure you to buy extra products or packages, such as their books or supplements, or attend one of their seminars  
    h. You do not feel good around them. You walk out feeling yelled at, misunderstood, upset, or unsafe
