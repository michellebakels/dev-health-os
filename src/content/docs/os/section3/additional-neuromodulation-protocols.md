## HeartMath Inner Balance 
HeartMath is a meditative protocol based on the idea that the heart and the brain are connected and that the heart plays a central role in regulating emotions and stress. 

One of HeartMath's main techniques is the HeartMath Inner Balance sensor, a wearable device that measures heart rate variability (HRV). HRV measures the fluctuation in time between heartbeats and is considered to be a marker of the body's stress level. The Inner Balance sensor connects to a smartphone app that provides feedback on HRV and guides the user through breathing and visualization exercises designed to help them regulate their emotions and reduce stress. 

## DNRS 
The Dynamic Neural Retraining System (DNRS) is a neuroplasticity-based program developed by psychologist Annie Hopper. It is a meditation/neuroplasticity protocol for people with overactive limbic systems, the part of the brain responsible for emotion, memory, and behavior. DNRS is designed to help individuals recover from a range of chronic health conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, multiple chemical sensitivity, and post-traumatic stress disorder. 

The DNRS program consists of a series of audio and visual training modules intended to retrain the brain and nervous system to respond appropriately to stimuli that may have previously triggered symptoms. It includes several different techniques, such as mindfulness, visualization, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to help individuals retrain their brains and improve their symptoms and is typically delivered through a combination of in-person and online training.

## The Gupta Programme 
The Gupta Programme is a neuroplasticity-based program developed by health practitioner Ashok Gupta. It is a meditation/neuroplasticity protocol for people with overactive limbic systems, the part of the brain responsible for emotion, memory, and behavior, and the program is targeted at patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and complex chronic conditions. 

The Gupta Programme consists of online training modules that include video lectures, visualizations, and other techniques designed to help individuals retrain their brains and reduce their symptoms. The program also includes a number of supplements and dietary recommendations. 

## rTMS 
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive procedure that uses a magnetic field to stimulate specific areas of the brain. It is used as a treatment for a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and Parkinson's disease. During rTMS treatment, a device is held near the head and produces a series of magnetic pulses that pass through the skull and into the brain. These pulses induce electrical currents in the brain, which can stimulate or inhibit the activity of neurons in the targeted area. 

There are several different types of rTMS, including low-frequency rTMS, which is thought to inhibit brain activity, and high-frequency rTMS, which is thought to stimulate brain activity. The specific type of rTMS used and the area of the brain targeted can vary depending on the disorder being treated. 

## Brain HQ 
Brain HQ is a suite of online brain-training exercises developed by the company Posit Science. The exercises are designed to improve various aspects of cognitive function, including memory, attention, processing speed, and problem-solving skills. 

The exercises are designed to challenge the brain and stimulate the development of new neural connections, which may help to improve cognitive function. BrainHQ exercises are delivered through a web-based platform and are available on a subscription basis. The exercises are typically organized into training programs that focus on specific cognitive skills, and users are encouraged to complete a set of exercises on a regular basis to see maximum benefits. 

## Mindfulness 
Mindfulness is a form of meditation that involves paying attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental way. There are many different mindfulness practices that may be helpful, such as mindfulness meditation, yoga, and tai chi. There are also smartphone apps such as Waking Up and Calm. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that mindfulness may have a number of benefits for brain health, including reducing stress and improving memory, attention, and decision-making, which promotes neuroplasticity and improves mood and emotions.
