As we better understand how the brain works, it is clear that strategies for improving brain health are very similar to those for improving physical health. Several daily activities are excellent for brain health and overall physical health. 
In order of impactfulness on brain health: 

1. **Exercise**  
Aerobic exercise, strength training, and interval training all promote the release of brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF). BDNF helps to enhance neuroplasticity, which is the brain’s ability to change and adapt to experience. It does this by promoting the growth of new neurons, improving the survival of existing neurons, and allowing neurons to build more robust connections between each other. Exercise can also have a number of benefits on your mental health, including reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety and improving overall well-being. A recent study looking at lifestyle changes and drugs on brain health found that exercise had the most positive effect on the transcription of DNA factors that positively impacted the brain by far. 

2. **Sleep**  
An appropriate amount of sleep is vital for the brain to function properly. Sleep helps the brain to process and consolidate memories from the day, thus facilitating learning. In addition, the brain’s lymphatic system helps to clear waste products and repair damaged
cells. Sleep also plays a role in regulating emotions and maintaining emotional well-being. When all this is taken into account, it’s easier to see that sleep isn’t a luxury; it’s a key component to crucial daily functioning. 

3. **Nutrition**  
The brain is made primarily of fat, so eating a diet with healthy fats such as omega-3 fats with an emphasis on DHA – the type of fats found in avocados, olive oil, nuts, and seeds, is critical. Eating whole foods found in nature (e.g., avoiding highly processed foods, sugar, and industrial seed oils) is a good strategy for brain and physical health. Lean protein sources help to provide building blocks for neurotransmitters and other brain chemicals. Fermented foods such as kombucha, kimchi, and sauerkraut all help to build healthy gut bacteria that are linked to better brain health. 

4. **Dental health**  
There is increasing evidence that infections that are set up in the gums, teeth, and nose can ultimately cross the blood-brain barrier and contribute to overall inflammation in the brain. 

5. **Gut health**  
The gut and brain are connected through the gut-brain axis, a complex network of signaling pathways that include direct nervous system connections and communication through the immune system, hormones, and neurotransmitters. The gut can have a significant impact on your overall mood and emotions as it produces many neurotransmitters, including serotonin. The gut can be a contributor to overall inflammation, which is a key root cause of diminished brain performance. The gut can also contribute to better production of BDNF, which helps with brain plasticity. 

6. **Stress management**  
Stress management techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, breathwork, and progressive muscle relaxation can all have a positive impact on your limbic system, which helps to regulate your “fight or flight response.” Calming this system creates better focus, concentration, and attention, as well as has an impact on your overall mood and emotions. 

In addition to adding positive lifestyle changes to support brain health, there are a number of things where exposure should be avoided or minimized:

1. **Toxins**  
Toxins can directly affect brain cells and connectivity; they can also interfere with the production and function of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that transmit messages between brain cells. Minimizing exposure to toxins by avoiding indoor air pollution and choosing products that are free of harmful chemicals is one effective strategy. Sometimes detoxification strategies are necessary but require the assistance of a healthcare professional. 

    There are a number of toxins that affect your brain’s health. Some of the biggest culprits include: 

    - Indoor air pollutants, including mold and volatile organic chemicals 
    - Chemicals such as glyphosate, pesticides, and fertilizers 
    - Metals such as mercury, cadmium, and lead 
    - Alcohol and recreational drugs

2. **Chronic infections**  
Chronic viral infections, including COVID-19, Epstein Barr, and chronic Lyme/tick-borne infections, can have a significant impact on brain health. 

3. **Side effects from pharmaceuticals**  
Some pharmaceuticals, such as statins, antidepressants, sleeping pills, pain pills, and antihistamines, can have cognitive or emotional side effects. When in doubt, check with your physician or a drug side effect database to see if any medication you’re taking poses a negative risk to your brain health. 

4. **Preventive strategies**  
Preventative strategies to protect you from traumatic brain injury, such as bicycle and motorcycle helmets, are more obvious safety measures, especially if there has been a history of a prior concussion.
