title: Tracking Our Sleep
description: Using data to learn how we sleep
---

Once in bed, the best thing for us to do, of course, is sleep. Without sleep technology, the greatest understanding we can have about how we're sleeping is not much more than how we feel in the morning. Unfortunately, that's not a very comprehensive understanding at all. Sleep trackers give us a complete picture of our mind and body restoration. 

Common devices, including the Oura Ring, Apple Watch, and the Eight Sleep mattress, collect and visualize our sleep data, inform us exactly how well we're sleeping, and direct us to where we need to improve. Is our sleep consistent? Are we hitting all sleep stages? Are we waking up often? How much of our time in bed is actually spent asleep? Are we sufficiently rested to begin the next day? Do we really need to prepare for 9 hours of sleep instead of 8? We can learn all of this and adjust where necessary.
