## Impact of Technology on Software Developers 

Software programmers spend a significant portion of their time interacting with technology. Whether it's coding, debugging, or communicating with colleagues, technology is an integral part of work. As technology becomes critical to our work, it is important to consider the potential negative effects it can have on our physical, mental, and emotional health. 

There is an emerging body of research that shows that technology can have a number of deleterious effects on the brain. The key points of this research are the following: 

1. **Technology is making it harder for us to focus, think deeply, and creatively.**  
Our brains are not well-suited to handle the constant distractions and interruptions of modern technology. They have evolved to focus on one task at a time, and regularly switching between tasks and constant distractions can result in cognitive overload and mental fatigue. Over time, the steady use of technology can rewire our brains and make it difficult to focus on one thing for an extended period of time. A study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology found that the mere presence of a smartphone, even when it is not in use, can impair our ability to focus and perform tasks. Another study published in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication found that participants who were exposed to a high number of notifications on their smartphones experienced increased feelings of stress and reduced ability to focus. 

2. **Technology can result in decreased working memory.**   
While having increased access to information at our fingertips may seem beneficial, it can negatively impact working memory since we no longer have to commit things to memory. A 2020 study published in Computers in Human Behavior found that the use of digital devices can negatively impact cognitive control and working memory, particularly in children and young adults. 

3. **Technology can result in increased feelings of stress, anxiety, poor sleep quality, and depression.**  
A 2015 review article in JAMA Psychiatry reviewed over 100 articles and found that excessive internet use is associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety. It is increasingly difficult for people to disconnect from technology and relax. One study published in the Journal of Social Science & Medicine found that individuals who spent more than two hours per day on social media had a significantly higher risk of developing depression compared to those who spent less time on social media. Another study
published in the Journal of Sleep Research found that the use of electronic devices before bedtime was associated with poor sleep quality and insomnia. 

Once we are conscious of the ways that technology can affect our brains, there are a number of intentional practices for technology use that can be implemented to regain control – especially in regard to our time and attention. These practices include:

1. **Use technology in a deliberate way.**  
Be conscious about your use of technology and ensure you get the maximum value. Declutter your digital life by going through all your apps and accounts and deleting or unsubscribing from the ones you don't use or that don't add value to your life. 
You can be more mindful of notifications by turning them off when they are not necessary. Also, consider how technology affects social interactions. For example, request that your guests or family members “check in” their phones to a bowl before having dinner. Additionally, it’s important to be mindful of the content that you're consuming. Research suggests that exposure to negative news and social media can increase stress and anxiety. It's essential to be selective about the content you're consuming. 

2. **Take intentional time breaks from technology.**  
You can set specific time limits for certain activities, such as checking email, or setting certain times of the day when you will not check your phone. Take a break from the computer screen on a regular basis in order to stretch, move, and rest your eyes. Consider taking a technology holiday where you disconnect for a certain period of time, ranging from a day to an entire vacation, to recharge and focus on other activities. To relieve any anxiety about taking a tech holiday, give your family, friends, and colleagues a heads-up about your unavailability and turn on an “out of office” automatic email response so people know that you will be away. 

3. **Do non-technologic activities.**  
Physical exercise, exposure to nature, and in-person connection with people have all been shown to reduce the deleterious effects of technology. 

4. **Pursue evidence-based strategies if you have stress, anxiety, poor sleep, or depression from high technology use.**  
Several studies show the positive impact of programs on these symptoms to retrain your brain, including mindfulness, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and 19 Channel QEEG Guided Neurofeedback.
