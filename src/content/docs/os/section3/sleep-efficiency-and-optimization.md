title: Sleep Efficiency and Optimization
description: The relationship between time asleep vs time in bed
---

Sleep efficiency is the relationship between the total time asleep compared to the total time in bed. A typical efficiency for a restful sleep is around 85% because, on average, we sleep for about an hour less than our time in bed. A sleep efficiency of 90% or higher is above average. If you are one of the millions who have trouble sleeping, there are ways to optimize and improve this number. One effective way to do this is by starting with a sleep tracker. Having daily metrics will guide our adjustments in our daytime routines and sleep decisions in ways we may otherwise be completely unaware of. The following suggestions detail ways we can optimize our sleep. 

### Cooling Mattress
A common reason for a restless night of sleep is that our body temperature rises to an uncomfortable level of heat that causes us to wake up, toss around, and flip our pillows endlessly. Cooling mattresses help pull the heat away from your body to maintain a lower body temperature, reduce restlessness, and increase sleep efficiency. There are various brands and levels of the cooling mattress. 

Companies like Casper and Purple have uniquely designed mattresses that cool the body with materials like gel and silicon. ChiliSleep and EightSleep take it a step further with built-in cooling technology that utilizes water channels to actively cool the bed. Recently, EightSleep introduced the Pod 3, complete with sleep tracking built into the top of the mattress for both sleep optimization and data visualization. With fewer disturbances throughout the night, greater sleep efficiency can mean longer time spent in deep and REM sleep stages. 

### Digital Disconnect
Avoiding blue light for 1 to 2 hours before bed is also shown to help us fall asleep more quickly. Blue light is emitted from common household items such as electronic device screens and LED and fluorescent light bulbs. Blue light is an energy booster, so limiting exposure to it in the last hour leading up to bedtime will aid in relaxing the mind and body. 

We can replace the habit of watching television or scrolling through our phones before bed with something we look forward to. Reading a book, journaling, preparing food for the next day, or doing a puzzle are some ways to wind down before bed. Find something that you truly look forward to doing, and start adding that to your pre-bedtime routine. Youâ€™re much more likely to stick to this habit when you find an activity you enjoy.
