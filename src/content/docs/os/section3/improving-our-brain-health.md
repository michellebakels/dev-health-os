Improving our brain health offers enormous benefits in our work and personal life. It provides us with the increased capability to achieve our individual goals through better focus, attention, memory, processing, and creativity. Additionally, it can provide us with the increased capability for enjoyment through reduced stress and anxiety, as well as increased pleasure, mindfulness, and well-being. Medical and practical knowledge of how to improve brain health is increasing rapidly through continued investments in researching this area. 

Despite this constantly evolving research, todayâ€™s environment is leading to an overall decline in brain health. For example, 1 out of 4 Americans are on a pharmaceutical for either depression or anxiety. This number has doubled from 1 out of 8 since 2019, no doubt driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to these increasing numbers, the software industry has now recognized anxiety and depression as important occupational hazards and that too much exposure to technology (e.g., blue light, constant phone time, being more isolated from individuals) can also create hazards to health in general.
