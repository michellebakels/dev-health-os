We've designed Developer Health OS to focus on three main areas, all of which aim to build a Restful Work environment: Burnout Recovery, Burnout Prevention, and Optimizing Performance.

### Restful Work

The goal of Developer Health OS is to allow us to achieve restful work regularly. We define Restful Work as a work week to look forward to, one that is filled with **joy and rest**, and which unfolds at a **calm**, unhurried pace. Restful work **encompasses both a physical time and place** as well as a **state of mind** where we are free to do our best work. Restful work allows us to devote our mental and physical resources to our jobs and the **freedom to pull back and acknowledge that work is just one part of our lives**. The days comprising a restful workweek have a **clear start and end, undisturbed personal time, and consistent, ample time for sleep**. Restful work means we are better parents, partners, friends, and employees. Restful work leads to putting our **health first** and, ultimately, finding a place of **deep contentment**.

**Burnout Recovery:** Identifying the issues that initially caused burnout and systematically developing healthier work habits and boundaries. 

**Burnout Prevention:** Building sustainable work habits to avoid experiencing burnout and repeating a cycle of ruin and recovery. 

**Optimum Performance:** Prioritizing oneâ€™s health can increase performance even without being specifically concerned about burnout. 

### CC 1.1: Visualize Your Ideal Environment
<em>If you can see it, you can achieve it. Visualize your ideal restful work environment. What time are you waking up in the morning? What are your work hours? What activities and hobbies are you engaged in? Who are you spending time with? How are you taking care of your mind and body? Be as specific and detailed as possible.</em>
