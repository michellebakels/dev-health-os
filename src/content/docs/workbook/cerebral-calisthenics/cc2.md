### What is burnout and is it affecting you? 

Everyone is going to have a different threshold for burnout, and there are external factors that may exacerbate feelings of burnout in your life over the course of your career. Still, it’s worth taking into account the various ways burnout can manifest itself in your life. Do any of these examples resonate with you? 

* Ceasing to exercise 
* Lack of hygiene 
* Drastic change in sleeping patterns 
* Forgoing recreational habits/activities that were once previously enjoyed  
* Extensive lack of energy and exhaustion 
* Not reserving time to rest and recover consistently, even if when feeling fine 
* Feeling a distance or increasing disconnection from friends, family, coworkers, and others in general
* Pursuit and expectation of perfection in all work 
* Negative overreactions to unexpected changes and challenges 
* Decrease in health/ increase in frequency of sickness 
* Low self-esteem, confidence, and/or sense of productivity 
* Decrease in productivity and loss of focus 
* Increased cynicism or annoyance with everyday situations 
* Feelings of depression and absenteeism 
* Increased and/or prolonged feelings of anxiety 
* Difficulty sleeping 


### CC 2.1
<em>The first step is to identify the problem. Read through the list of burnout indicators above and take a moment to write which symptoms resonate with you. Add anything else that you’re feeling that seems like a symptom of burnout. Remember, your feelings of exhaustion and overwell don’t need to look like anyone else’s.</em>

### CC 2.2
<em>For a more in-depth assessment of your work habits that may be leading to burnout, check out the following Workaholics Anonymous diagnostic tests. Make personal notes of your results. Go beyond surface-level observations and take some time to digest the results and reflect on how these things make you feel.</em>

### CC 2.3
<em>Setting your time expectations. Now that you know what direction you’d like to move in, take a moment to set realistic time blocks. Be as specific as possible when deciding on your time commitment (e.g., when and on which days will you work on installing your restful work DHOS).  See Section 1: Setting Time Expectations in the DHOS for more info.</em>

### CC 2.4
<em>Setting your cost expectations. Next, how much can you invest in your mental and physical well-being? We suggest 4% of your net income, however, you will need to find the right amount that you feel comfortable with. First, calculate your number. Next, decide what you would spend that money on. Be specific about what type of environment you would create for yourself (e.g., updating your desk, buying a new office chair, or adding art to your space), and what external services (e.g., therapy, sleep trackers, massages, vacations) you will need. See Section 1: Setting Cost Expectations in the DHOS for more info.</em>

### CC 2.5
<em>Moving from vagueness to clarity with TASHA. While time is the first thing we want to move from vagueness to clarity with, it is not the only thing. We also want to gather data and have clarity in the following areas. Answer the following questions to give a clearer understanding of where you are in the burnout cycle.  See Section 1: TASHA in the DHOS for more info. 

* (T)ime - How am I spending it and in what areas? 
* (A)ttention - What are my “hell yeahs” in life and work? 
* (S)leep - How much am I actually sleeping, and what is the quality? 
* (H)abits - What are the habits that I want to add to my life? 
* (A)ddiction - Do I struggle with addiction to work or other areas of life?
