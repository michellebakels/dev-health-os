title: What Can it Help With?
description: We focus on helping with three main areas
---

We've designed Developer Health OS to focus on three main areas: *burnout recovery, burnout prevention, and optimizing performance.*

**Burnout Recovery:** Identifying the issues that initially caused burnout and systematically developing healthier work habits and boundaries.

**Burnout Prevention:** Building sustainable work habits to avoid experiencing burnout and repeating a cycle of ruin and recovery.
 
**Optimum Performance:** Prioritizing health first can increase performance even without being specifically concerned about burnout.

The goal of Developer Health OS is to allow us to achieve restful work regularly. We define Restful Work as a work week to look forward to, filled with joy and rest at an unhurried pace. It's a place where we do our best work, yet it's just one part of our life. The days comprising a restful work week have a clear start and end, undisturbed personal time, and consistent, ample time for sleep. Restful work means we are better parents, partners, friends, and employees. Restful work leads to putting our health first and finding more often than not a place of deep contentment.
