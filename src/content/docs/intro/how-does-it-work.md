title: How Does it Work?
description: Getting the most out of The Developer Health OS

We've developed a curriculum that covers three main areas

1. Challenging our thinking
- Identifying pathways of healing: Truly understanding issues is the basis for creating meaningful growth.
- Replacing lies with truth: Direct questions and honest answers peel away assumptions to make improvement.
- Encouraging experimentation: Test multiple approaches and theories to find what works best.
- Building a data warehouse: “What gets measured, improves”, including personal health.

2. Changing our work habits
- Slow down as the foundation: Everything in restful work begins with slowing down.
- Work is only one part of our life: Work is a part of our life, but not the most important part.
- Health cannot be dropped: Health is a glass ball (as opposed to a rubber ball) that shatters when dropped.
- Avoid adrenalizing: Artificial pressure and adrenalizing lead to workaholism which must be avoided at all costs.

3. Rewiring our brain
- Burnout is trauma: Trauma is stored in the limbic system and increases the likelihood of burnout.
- Trauma affects workplace productivity: Trauma negatively affects focus, initiative, compassion, and learning.
- Trauma is common and widespread: Trauma is not confined to extreme cases of PTSD and abuse.
- We can optimize our brains: The brain's neuroplasticity allows for rewiring, unlearning, and optimizing.
