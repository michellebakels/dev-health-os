We've designed Developer Health OS for the knowledge worker that specifically works in the field of technology. We refer to this as the "tech worker." Working on a computer all day, often in a fast moving, isolated environment, is uniquely challenging. Humans were not designed to sit in front of a computer for 6-12 hours at a time solving complex problems. We were not designed to deal with multiple inboxes full of emails and DM's coming at us from every direction. Therefore, tech workers are often self-injured and burned out due to relying upon a part of our body (our brain) that was not built for this.

Since our mission at G2i is specifically focused on software developers, Developer Health OS will speak most directly to the developer, but is broad enough to benefit any tech worker.
