title: Who created the OS?
description: The people and their motivations behind the OS 
---

Our motivation behind creating the Developer Health OS comes from deeply personal experiences surrounding our own health in the tech industry.

### Gabe Greenberg
##### Founder & CEO of G2i
Gabe spent more than 8 years suffering from a chronic illness rooted in consistent overworking. While building the company, Gabe clocked 60 to 70-hour work weeks on average, all while growing more distant from his wife and young children. For years, Gabe experienced extreme headaches, fatigue, and pain throughout his body on a daily basis. It wasn't until he was diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) caused by exposure to toxic mold that he was forced to slow down and reevaluate his work/life priorities and practices.

The path to recovery required honest self-reflection, regularly meeting with health professionals for both mental and physical health, leadership coaching, and a complete overhaul of the ways in which Gabe worked and ran his company. This was only made possible by the support of the global developer ecosystem that rallied behind Gabe, raised money for his medical expenses, and offered him encouragement.

Creating developer health programming and resources is a means of giving back to the developer community that aided Gabe's recovery, without question, and paying forward the aid he received. Reflecting back, Gabe's story isn't unique, and our story isn't unique -- the industry already planted the seeds of support and our goal is to simply water, or champion, this existing foundation.

### Michelle Bakels
##### Program Director at G2i
Michelle has been a software developer for the last several years at companies of various sizes and industries. Although her first job was with a phenomenal company, the team she was personally on was unfortunately saddled with bureaucracy that allowed harassment and toxic behavior to continue for years without accountability. Without prior experience in the tech industry she attempted to push through the nearly daily issues until the point the stress manifested into an unignorable heart condition that affected every part of her life from work meetings to washing dishes.

At this point Michelle was told by her cardiologist that the only way to alleviate her heart issues was to remove the stressors causing it while managing the symptoms with a temporary prescription. She changed jobs and everything seemed great… until it wasn’t. After the dynamics of this job became worse than her previous one, her heart condition returned worse as well. Defeated, she wondered if every job would be like this and that staying in tech meant enduring heart issues indefinitely.

After meeting Gabe through their local tech community in South Florida they both learned about their shared experiences with health issues. Gabe and Michelle agreed that the industry lacked a dedicated focus on the health of technologists despite how common it is for tech workers to experience burnout, extreme stress, and more. Shortly after, Michelle officially joined G2i to lead programming and initiatives to support the physical and mental health of developers – including this one! The Developer Health Operating System!
